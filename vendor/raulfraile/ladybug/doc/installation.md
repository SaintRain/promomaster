# Installation

The recommended way to install Ladybug is through [Composer](http://packagist.org/about-composer). Just create a `composer.json file for your project:

``` json
{
    "require": {
        "raulfraile/ladybug": "~1.0"
    }
}
```
To actually install Ladybug in your project, download the composer binary and run it:

``` bash
wget http://getcomposer.org/composer.phar
# or
curl -O http://getcomposer.org/composer.phar

php composer.phar install
```

After running the `install` command, a new directory called 'vendor' will contain the Ladybug code, as well as all
the required dependencies.

Once added the autoloader you will have access to the library:

``` php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

## Troubleshooting

### Maximum function nesting level error

The Xdebug extension protects you again infinite recursion limiting the maximum function nesting level. By default,
this value is 100, too low for current projects. If you get this error:

`Fatal error: Maximum function nesting level of '100' reached, aborting!`

Change the `xdebug.max_nesting_level` PHP setting to, at least, 200.
